            **Round 1 · ARGUE · Alex Morgan (Researcher)**

            **Round 1 focus:** Stage microgrid commissioning so that tenant benefits show up in billing by month six.

**Scenario snapshot:** Cambridge Housing Authority seeks a 650 kW solar + 2.5 MWh storage microgrid at Riverside Homes to shave bills ~18% while providing 8-hour outage resilience.

**Evidence highlights:**
- Greenspark EPC bid locks in $1.95/W turnkey price with performance bonding.
- Tenant energy burden currently 12% of income; housing authority aims to cut to 8%.
- Microgrid control tested in Worcester pilot reduced outage downtime by 72%.

**Implementation path:**
1. Secure MassCEC grant agreement signature by week 6.
2. Train onsite maintenance staff on battery O&M before commissioning.
3. Run tenant co-design workshops to codify bill credit policy by week 9.

**Risk watchlist:**
- Storage degradation assumptions rely on 4,000 cycles; need warranty alignment.
- Tenant savings must be codified in lease amendments to avoid billing disputes.

            **Round 1 · CRITIQUE · Jordan Lee (Critic)**

            **Round 1 critique:** Focusing on stubborn weaknesses.

**Major concerns:**
- Load-model mismatch: Peak winter load (1.6 MW) exceeds storage output; outage coverage unclear.
- Tenant safeguards: Need signed policy guaranteeing minimum 15% bill reduction in first year.

**Clarifying asks:**
- What is the fallback if MassCEC funding slips a quarter?
- How will tenant training handle language access for Cantonese and Spanish speakers?

**Risk posture:** Residual risk currently sits at medium-high because monetized resilience value is still assumptive.

            **Round 1 · DEVIL · Casey Vega (Devil's Advocate)**

            **Devil's Advocate (Round 1):** Stress-testing optimism.

**Contrarian evidence:**
- Tenant trust can fray if bills lag behind savings; once lost, political capital is gone.
- If ISO-NE enforces new dual participation rules, the revenue stack could collapse.

**Worst-case storyline:** In a downside market, the co-op could face a $220k funding hole.

Let's force the team to show contingency math before we pretend consensus exists.

            **Round 1 · REVISE · Alex Morgan (Researcher)**

            **Researcher revision (Round 1):** Integrating critiques into the plan.

**Adjustments committed:**
- Resized storage to 3.1 MWh with demand response; outage coverage meets 10-hour target.
- Drafted bilingual tenant benefit charter; legal review scheduled for next Tuesday.

**Fresh evidence:** Secured EPC letter committing to $1.92/W turnkey cap backed by performance guarantees.

**Next actions:** Kick off tenant co-design workshop and lock interconnection study date.

            **Round 1 · SYNTHESIZE · Priya Singh (Synthesizer)**

            **Synthesizer (Round 1 wrap):** We are close to consensus.

**Outstanding issues:** Regulatory whiplash

**Progress markers:**
- Resized storage to 3.1 MWh with demand response; outage coverage meets 10-hour target.
- Drafted bilingual tenant benefit charter; legal review scheduled for next Tuesday.

**Narrative to brief stakeholders:** Revision landed real movement on tenant protections.

            **Round 2 · ARGUE · Alex Morgan (Researcher)**

            **Round 2 focus:** Bundle solar, storage, and demand response to guarantee 18% utility savings.

**Scenario snapshot:** Cambridge Housing Authority seeks a 650 kW solar + 2.5 MWh storage microgrid at Riverside Homes to shave bills ~18% while providing 8-hour outage resilience.

**Evidence highlights:**
- Tenant energy burden currently 12% of income; housing authority aims to cut to 8%.
- Synapse 2024 load study shows average winter peak 1.32 MW; solar covers 48% daytime load.
- Microgrid control tested in Worcester pilot reduced outage downtime by 72%.

**Implementation path:**
1. File interconnection application with Eversource in month 2; expedite via municipal liaison.
2. Phase construction so the community center island mode goes live by month 8.
3. Run tenant co-design workshops to codify bill credit policy by week 9.

**Risk watchlist:**
- Outstanding review items: Regulatory whiplash
- Storage degradation assumptions rely on 4,000 cycles; need warranty alignment.
- Sponsor must model winter storm islanding scenario explicitly.

**Addressing prior critique:** Feedback last round: **Devil's Advocate (Round 1):** Stress-testing optimism.

**Contrarian evidence:**
- Tenant trust can fray if bills lag behind savings; once lost, political capital is gone.
- If ISO-NE enforces new dual participation rules, the revenue stack could collapse.

**Worst-case storyline:** In a downside market, the co-op could face a $220k funding hole.

            **Round 2 critique:** Focusing on stubborn weaknesses.

**Major concerns:**
- Load-model mismatch: Peak winter load (1.6 MW) exceeds storage output; outage coverage unclear.
- Tenant safeguards: Need signed policy guaranteeing minimum 15% bill reduction in first year.
- Regulatory whiplash: Rule changes on community solar crediting could erode projected savings by up to 35%.
- Capital gap: Even with grants there is a $310k funding hole; what bridge financing covers it?

**Clarifying asks:**
- How will tenant training handle language access for Cantonese and Spanish speakers?
- Who owns cybersecurity risk once the microgrid controller is online?

**Risk posture:** Residual risk currently sits at medium-high because monetized resilience value is still assumptive.

            **Round 2 · DEVIL · Casey Vega (Devil's Advocate)**

            **Devil's Advocate (Round 2):** Stress-testing optimism.

**Contrarian evidence:**
- A stalled interconnection queue could delay energization by 18 months, nullifying cost savings.
- Tenant trust can fray if bills lag behind savings; once lost, political capital is gone.

**Worst-case storyline:** In a downside market, the co-op could face a $220k funding hole.

            **Researcher revision (Round 2):** Integrating critiques into the plan.

**Adjustments committed:**
- Structured savings sharing clause so tenants insulated from net-metering cuts.
- Proposed using Inflation Reduction Act elective pay plus city green bond bridge.

**Fresh evidence:** Validated storage dispatch model against ISO-NE winter peaks; 90% of outage use case holds.

**Next actions:** Kick off tenant co-design workshop and lock interconnection study date.
